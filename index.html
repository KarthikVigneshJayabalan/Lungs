  <h1 class="titlepage" >The Respiratory System</h1>
  <p>The respiratory system consists of organs and
     structures that allow us to breathe by taking
      in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. The 
      main parts include the lungs, nasal cavity,
  sinuses, blood vessels, and various air passageways.</p>
   <h3>Nasal cavity</h3>
   <img height="450" width="450" src="18e9f5c4-a394-42c4-b477-89345b908ec14701553587067582991.jpg">
   <h3>The nasal cavity is the inside of your nose. It is lined with a mucous membrane
      that helps keep your nose moist by making mucus so you won't get nosebleeds from a
       dry nose. There are also little hairs that help filter the air you breathe in, 
       blocking dirt and dust from getting into your lungs</h3>
       <hr>
   <h3>Throat</h3>
   <p>The hollow tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and ends at the top of
       the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (the tube that goes to the stomach). The 
       throat is about 5 inches long, depending on body size. Also called pharynx.</p>
       <hr>    
   <h3>The Larynx</h3>
   <p>Larynx, also called voice box, a hollow, tubular structure connected to the top
      of the windpipe (trachea); air passes through the larynx on its way to the lungs.</p>
     <hr>     
   <h3>Epiglottis</h3>
   <p>The epiglottis is a flap in the throat that keeps food from entering the windpipe 
     and the lungs. It's attached to the entrance of the larynx and stands open during 
     breathing, allowing air to flow into the larynx. But during swallowing, it closes to
      force liquids or food into the esophagus instead</p>
      <hr>
 </body>
    <h3>Trachea</h3>
    <p>The trachea, commonly known as the windpipe, is a tube about 4 inches long and 
      less than an inch in diameter in most people. The trachea begins just under the 
      larynx (voice box) and runs down behind the breastbone (sternum). The trachea then
       divides into two smaller tubes called bronchi: one bronchus for each lung.</p>
       <hr>   
       <h3>Lungs</h3>
    <p>The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the 
      chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through
       its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and
      smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic.
     <hr>
     <h3>Diaphragm</h3>
  <p>This thin, dome-shaped muscle separates the chest from the abdomen and is the principal muscle of respiration. As the diaphragm contracts and flattens, it creates a vacuum, pulling air into the lungs. Then when the muscle relaxes, air is pushed out of the lungs.</p>   
      <h3>Bronchus</h3>
     <p>e bronchi are the airways that lead from the trachea into the lungs and then 
       branch off into progressively smaller structures until they reach the alveoli, 
       the tiny sacs that allow for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the 
       lungs.</p>
      <hr>
       <h3>Bronchioles</h3>  
    <p>The bronchioles or bronchioli are the smaller branches of the bronchial airways 
      in the respiratory tract. They include the terminal bronchioles, and finally the respiratory
       bronchioles that mark the start of the respiratory zone delivering air to the gas exchanging
    units of the alveoli. The bronchioles no longer contain the cartilage that is found
         in the bronchi, or glands in their submucosa.</p>
      <hr>
         <h3>Alveoli</h3>
      <p>A pulmonary alveoli also known as an air sac or air space is one of millions of 
        hollow, distensible cup-shaped cavities in the lungs where oxygen is exchanged for 
        carbon dioxide. Alveoli make up the functional tissue of the lungs known as the lung 
        parenchyma, which takes up 90 percent of the total lung volume.</p>
       <hr>
        <h3>Oxygen in respiratory system</h3>
      <p>The lungs and respiratory system allow us to breathe. They bring oxygen into our
         bodies (called inspiration, or inhalation) and send carbon dioxide out 
         (called expiration, or exhalation). This exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is 
         called respiration.</p>
